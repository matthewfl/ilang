Notes on levels of debugging printing:
	Using negative values in the code, added to a large positive number, can increase the places of the debugger by increaseing the overall value and then making a more negative number.

	Default level: 
	Overall debug level: 10
	-10: (always print) NOTHING
	-9:

	
	-7: modules
	-6: Parse tree overall run
	-5: Parser tree parse
