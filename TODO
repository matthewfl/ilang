Networking:
To make the system able to work over the network I need to transisition it to use a callback like system, so that data can be delayed
what will need to happen is that there is some even loop like system, and that it will be able to use callbacks to get values over network

I am thinking that for the first version I could use threads, there is a yeild system, then there could be a relativetly simple even system used for waking up the threads when something happends, that should keep the design simpler
